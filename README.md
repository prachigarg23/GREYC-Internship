# GREYC-Internship
## Gating mechanisms in CNNs inspired by memorization and generalization


This is the code repository for work done during my internship at GREYC laboratory from 3st June - 28th August, 2019 under the mentorship of Dr. Frederic Jurie, Dr. Alexis Lechervy and Shivang Aggarwal. The repository contains code implementation of various experiments conducted by applying gating mechanisms on Resnets for cifar 10 and cifar 100 datasets.
